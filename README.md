# PITT_Simple-Program
Week 6/7 Lab

This program takes in a name, and two numbers. It will output everything appropriately thereafter.

After this, it will print out various ways of performing arithmetic with the two numbers given. It will reverse the numbers as well for specific arithmetic that would output different values than the previous values. This can be seen with the subtraction and the division portions of the program.
