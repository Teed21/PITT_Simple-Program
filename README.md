# PITT_Simple-Program
Week 6/7 Lab

# Code of Conduct
The code of conduct is fairly straight forward, and lines up with my views. Just be nice and don't try to ruin the project.

# Licensing
The licensing is a choice I took very lightly. I am open for anyone to use and distribute the software as seen fit by the downloading party.

# The Program:

This program takes in a name, and two numbers. It will output everything appropriately thereafter.

After this, it will print out various ways of performing arithmetic with the two numbers given. It will reverse the numbers as well for specific arithmetic that would output different values than the previous values. This can be seen with the subtraction and the division portions of the program.
